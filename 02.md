# Materials concepts

Stress is force per area.
stress is press  
strain is pain  

A large modulous implies a very stiff material.

Think constraints when designing for rigidity - A cross beam in an ikea bookshelf is an example of a constraint.

Think degrees of freedom - you can couple degrees of freedom. 

# This week we make electronics.

An embedded device.

# PCB - Printed Circuit Boards

In industry, PCBs are made with etching.

Chemical waste is toxic

We will mill, not etch. It's less toxic. easier to setup friendlier for the lab, friedlier to the environment.

# tutorials

Neil wants us to update the tutorial in the archive. 

# we will machine PCBs

roland dga - the machine we will use. 

first, clean the bed

fixturing - use double stick tape to hold the board from below - claping it causes it to bow/break the bit

we only need to remove a tenth of a millimeter. Do do this, zero the mill. 

The **set screw** holds the **end mill** at a speciffic level. 

loose the set screw, and very gently lower the end mill on to the copper. 
tighten the set screw, and gently tap the board to settle the

After milling, **de-burring** will remove small fine features/artifacts from the milling process. 

wash with soap and water

# Vinyl Cutter
Can also use the vinyl cutter to make flexible circuits. More difficult than machining. 

#PCB materials

common green PCBs are **fr4** -- epoxy with glass encasing. These cannot be machined -- they destroy the endmills.

We use **fr1**. This CAN be machined. 

more examples are on the web page

# practical

If you want tens of copies of a board, milling is okay. For more than that, you usually send it off to a manufacturer. 
$100 and a couple days is usually what it takes to get a batch of boards. 

# layers
Most boards in the class are one sided. 
A 1.5 sided board implies that there is one layer of traces, and a few jumpers where the routing requires traces to pass over each other.

**vias** are connections between layers. 

# soldering 

more difficult than it looks.
soldered joints should be shinny and smooth. 

## soldering a connection

- clean the solder tip.
- "wet" the tip with solder
- pres the tip to the work. 
- heat the joint. (wait for a moment)
- press the solder to the joint (wait for it to heat)
- remove the tip

don't to the big parts first. 

go bottom to top, inside to outside

wash the board with soap and water.


# actually milling
go from .png to rml to cut traces. (use fab modules? neil says that this is the best option)

# stuffing the boards (assembly)
Diodes have a line that shows you where the cathode is

# A handy trick
for really detailed soldering, just add a mountain of solder, then use the braid to clean away the excess.

# Soldering Notes

If the soldering tip is not "wetting" correctly, the solder will "ball up" when it touches the tip. 
Several things could be wrong.

- Try wetting the sponge, and use it to clean the tip - cleaning the tip usually helps
- sometimes you can fix the tip by roughing it with light snadpaper
- You may need to replace the soldering tip. Soldering iron tips are "consumables"
