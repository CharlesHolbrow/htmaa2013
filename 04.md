# Computer-Controlled Machining

http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_machining/index.html

## rigid foam insulation 

### edges are coarse
paint the foam with gesso and then sand it.
Use a heat gun

## 4 x 8 plywood

Medium density fiberboard (MDF)
- chopped wood in a binder
- machines nicely
- sometimes the binder is toxic, sometimes it's natural
- poor mechanical properties

Medium Densito Overlay (MDO) 
- better for surfaces, 

Oriented Strand Board (OSB) Sheathing 
- Reasonable density, mechanical properties
- very cheap 


# Machines

We also have the a 5 axis large format shopbot

CBA has a machining center 5 axic

we have a lathe  for "Turning"

We have a waterjet cutter too

- Glass -- best if the glass is laminated with a sacrificial layer
- Steel
- Cermic

# tooling

flutes - the number of spirals 

center cutting tools can be used like a drill

Up cut or down cut - which wa does the 

Downcut 
- cleaner on top, less clean cut on bottom

Upcut
- less clean on top, more clean cut on buttom


Ball ends for curvy  surfaces 

flat ends for flatter surfaces


# Machining Parameters

how deep is each cut?
how fast to you move the head?
cut depth - dont got over the tool diameter (typically) -- but it depends on the material

Chip load is a measurement thereof 

Overlap - how much does each tool path -- 50% is a typical amount


# to machine glass 
You can machine some hard materials with a bit that does not have flutes at all - just an abrasive surface on the bottom of the bit. 


# fixtures

- Clamps
- glue gunn
- just use weight for some options 
- just drill holes and screw screws into the sacraficial layer underneath
- vaccum beds - a lot of bother to keep it clean
- encapsulation - cover in a alloy 

# Toolpaths

when machining, "kerf" is the material that is removed. Ideally, the kerf is same as the bit diameter

"Offset" is displacing for the size of the tool

conventional vs climb machining - does the bit turn away or toward the the material that is beign cut. 

lead in vs lead out - where do you start? where do you punch through?

Rough cut vs Finish cut - rough cut is is cutting in layers  - finish cutting is ?

# Fab modules

.stl

make_stl_sbp # stl -> shopbot
make_png_ord # png -> .ord for waterjet

# Safety

Safety Glasses  
Shoes that protect your feet  
Always know the emegengy stop button before starting
Never do alone
Go to the EHS page to MIT - do the online training - I think I already do this  

# Assignment

Make something Big
The goal ls learning tooling and path planning for lage format machining

7/16ths of an inch

# TAs

Sophia and Dan 

# for finishing insulation foam

Blick White Gesso - an extra think paint that sands nicely

# great material for casting
