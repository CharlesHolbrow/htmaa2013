3d print sounds great, but have serious limitations.

The benefit of 3d Printing is that while you are building it you have access to the internals. 

## constraints 

limited materials, mostly plastic

abs plastic
high impact polystyrene
PLA - poly lactic acid

3d printing metal is much more complex and expensive

Resolution is much lower than subtractative

overhangs add complexity

it's slow - hours to make almost anything,

There's a minimum thickness.

# lots of ways to 3d Print

stereolithography - use a laser and a resin  
fuse depossition modeling -- 3d glue gun  
- spread a layer of powder followd by a layer of binder  
ink-jet binder  - droplets of acrylic that you can UV cure  
paper 3d printer  
selecting laser synerinc - used for polymers and metals  
use the laser to selectivley melt powder and stic it together - Horibly expensive  
two photon proceseese - Super high resolution - micron scale - UV Curing - not usefull  

# Assignment

## design and print an object
Make a small object that could not be made subtractativley
(nested parts or overhangs)

FDM is a good starting material

### software options

123d is a fine option  
sketchup is a fine free option
solidworks  
inventor  
fab modules  
- hds to stl  
- fabserver - choose fabricate option, load  
kokopeli  
meshlab

### scanning
you get a cloud of points   
you need to triangulate it  
then texture it  

Lot's of differnet options for scanning

Photogrammetry 
123D catch is the consumer version. 

# computer represetations

## solid modeling

FRep - Functional Representation  
BRep - Bondary Representation  

STL is the most common file format for 3D printing
- just consists of triangles
- describes the object as a mesh
- Doesn't have units
- No good way to have multiple materials

AMF file format is a successor to STL
- It's a messy format though
- however it does have units

.OBJ .3ds
- These are proprietary formats that have become standard - most software can read them. 

.DXF
- Don't use this 

# Save objects as

- meshes
- surfaces
- equations
