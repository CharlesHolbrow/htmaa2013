# Output Devices

100 milliamps can kill you

use a diode to ensure that you don't plug your board in the wrong way, which can fry your board

# Power Supplies

Spec'd by Voltage, Current, Noise

A switcher is noisy, but you can add a filter to make it bigger - 10s of dollars

Linear power supplies are low noise. - tens to hundreds of dollars

# LEDs

simple LEDs are about 10 cents each

## Charlieplexing

control (n^2) -1 led's with n pins.

each pin controls a column and a row -- but it works because the current can only go one way through a the LEDs.

attiny44 can just barely do video. 

# Sound

PWMing MOSFET doesn't dissipate power in the transistor. This is why it's better than just sending a voltage?
