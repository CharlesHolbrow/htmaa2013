- sam Backgorund in Math and Physics. Background Simulation, physics - made kayak
- Matt - computational biology
- James - Master of Architecture, Parametric modeling, worked for Ford in product dev
- Justin - Manages the Architecture Shop. 
- Skyler Tibbits - faculty in the Architecture. Does Comp Sci
- Seth - Shop manager for the ACT. Good for help with low tech stuff- Welding, woordworking
- John Maher - master of architecture student here

Work with the shop management if you need tools you aren't trained for

The last 15 minutes of each class will be lab sessions. We will progress for more open access as the shop managers get to know us. 

# Project Management

# Today Homework:

Snap together construction kit. Do this first. 

Once the laster cutting is progressing, THEN make a page in the class archive.

# Version Control

Here's Niel's mercurial resources 
http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_management/archive.html

```
hg clone 
hg commit -m 'Fixes lots of bugs'
```

# We will make websites documenting our work

Don't put video in the the archives.  
For video, use a video hosting site, and link to the page.   
Use Windows friendly file names
SeaMonkey included a free WYSIWYG web authoring tool  
LibreOffice Writer/Web  

# Computer controlled Cutting

Use Fab modules OR printer driver. 

## Vinyl cutter  

The most under appreciated device  
Can cut what you can cut with an xacto knife.  
Cut and score Paper
Cut Masks and use them for screen printing 

Copper and epoxy film - Vynl cutter can be used to make flexible multi-layer ciruits.

On the vynl cutter you need to set the force and cutting speed depending on the material and the design.

Weeding is pulling out the parts you don't want to leave the parts you do want. 
Don't weed before transfering. 

No assignment, but just play with it.

Our vinyl cutter uses "hpdg" - an old language that hp developed.


## Laser cutter

The most used tool in the class.  
Use it in raster mode or to engrave. However, the focus of the class in is to cut out shapes.

For Press fit constcution you need to be 5000th of an inch. This just relies on friction.

Flectures are parts that bend. Neil will add some links to the page.

Laser can burn, melt, or ablate. the material you are cutting goes somewhere. 

The fab modules created by Neil and his class. allow us to set a laser intensity range for light and dark colors.

Inscape software includes a 

Don't just make your project, first just make your joint. 

Fab modules support the "eplilog" format. 

### Danger

They all catch on fire. Never leave the laser. Keep an eye on it. 

Don't cut PVC in the laser cutter. 

### materials

Our laser cutter can cut wood, acrylic or cardboard.  
We want cardboard to bend not crease - for optimal lser cutting.
