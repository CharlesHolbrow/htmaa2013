# Wires

speced by awg. Google awg current

# Buttons 

- normally open, closed when pushed
- slide switch

# resistors

current = I = V/R

# Capacitor

stores charge

current vs. rate of change of voltage

# crylstals and resonators

# inductros

essentially coils of wire

relationship between voltage and derivative of current

voltage

store magnetic fields 

# Diodes

conduct only in one direction

current flows from anode to cathode

Schottkey diode drops a few tenths of a volt before it starts conducting

Zener diode  - used to clip voltage - voltage restricted to a range

## LED

always need a current reducing resistor  - The job of an LED is to have no resistance

# transistor [ca]

PNP

NPN

MOSFET - used for power electornics

NMOSFET - syncs current 

PMOSFET - courses current

# Voltage regulator

EX: input designed to be 6 Volts  up to 30 Volts - output is always 5V

limited by the current they can handle

# Op Amps

differential amplifier

microcontrollers now have analog gains built in to them - so Op Amps are less usefull then in the past

# Microcontrollers

We Use the ATtiny44A. It has lot of modular systems - (unlike a microprocessor)

# Kirchoffs Law

the current into a node is the same as the current out of that node

#
The voltage drop around a loop adds up to zero

Power = i^2 r

# EDA - Electronic Design Automation

Electronics Design needs to be hierachical and parametric

WHen designing you typically use a Part Library

Consider Design Rules = Minimum wire thinkess, spacing 

# Assignment
draw resistor and a led on one pin, and a switch on another pin

Route the traces

Optionally simulate

output for fabrication

# Eagle

Software for making circuit boards
- new project
- new schematic
- Add button to add parts from the the parts library
- route wires
- Select PCB layout
- bow draw the paths

- select layers to be visible
- Export image

- Comes with a Good .pdf tutorial

Linear Technology has a nice simulator

# Assignment

Draw the schematic from scratch

Add a button and a light

# Simulation Software

LTSpice is a good option

circuitlab.com is a decent browser based option

# Expensive
OTLab
