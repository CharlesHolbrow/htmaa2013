# Composites

Large, Light, Strong, Curvy things. 

Fibers/Cloth is strong in tension, but useless in compression.
Drystone is the opposite. 

Composites combine the two to make strong, light material.

Composites are built of a **fiber** and a **matrix**

## Fiber

- Fabrics are most common
- carbon
- glass

We will use natural fibers, burlap

## Resin

We use epoxy -needs good, but not great ventilation (no respirator needed)

Urethane is also used.

# Plys 

the number of layers in a composite fabric

# Open vs Close molds 

With open molds and vacuum you get only one nice side. 

For Larger Parts you need Vacuum Bagging.
