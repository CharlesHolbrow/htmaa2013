# Molding and Casting

Cheaper than 3D printing esp. at scale


# Assignment

design the mold
mill the mold
cast parts


# ~ 5 types of molding

# Injection Molding

best for 1000s of parts and beyond

Think of how the Characters in the game of Risk come -- all attached to a grid. 

The Grid is known as

# Insert molding

Mold around something

# Vacuum Molding

The workhorse for packaging. Annoying packaging for consumer projects. 

Low Resolution 

# Blow Molding

How bottles are made. heat material which is a tube, and blow air into it. It expands to a mold.

# Soft Molding

- machinable Wax

Our stock for the assignment - (dimensions in inches)

1.5 x 3 x 7

Can use the Modela OR the shopbot. The shopbot can go much quicker.

- Foam insulation - 2 inch thick.
- Workflow:
  - mill the foam
  - paint it with gesso
  - sand it down


ALginate gel - good for body parts

You can cast directly from wax, but it it's hard to get your part out of it. 

## OOMOO

Silicon Rubber designed for this purpose
Default cast material for thie weeks assignment

## Urethane Rubber

A little stronger than OOMOO. A little less friendly (environmentally) however it's still non-toxic.

Can use Urethane Rubber to cast OOMOO and vice versa.

## PDMS

Completely Clear, and works for nano-meter resolutions

## Latex

Never use it. It's a surface cure, not a volume clear. Paint it on, wait for it to dry, paint it on, wait for it to dry, etc. 

# Inside the mold

Thermoplastic can be melted and re-used.
Thermoset cannot be re-used. 

## DryStone and HydroStone

Neil's favorite materials. 

hydrostone is based on portland-cement (the basis for concrete)  
Hydrostone takes a little longer to dry. (overnight perhaps). A bit stronger than hydrostone. (Both are pretty strong though)

Drystone is perfectly white.  
Hydrostone is not perfectly white.

# Metal

Not optimal for this weeks assignment. 

## Mold Max 60 

a rubber that goes up to 560 Fahrenheit

Babbitt Bearing Grade 3 Super Tough Allow Ingots

# Food

Use food safe rubber
Reynolds has it in stock.
