# Embedded Programming

http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/index.html

# Architectures
8051 - a poor instruction set  
msp - 16bit low power and fast  
arm - stm32 - processor family many vendors produce - use this if you outgrow the AVR 
avr - good - neil likes these - ground up modern architecture. Great tool support. 

# Data Sheet

Attiny44a - Neil wants us to read it. 

Section 15. Analog Comparitor - read this. 

# Clocks

THe processor has a clock 

RC (10%, 1% calibrated)
ceramic (0.5%)
quartz (50ppm)

# loading software (in-system development)

ISP Header is the 2x3 pin grid that we use to program

A boot loader is a program to load programs - replaces ISP with a header.

avrdude - the program we use to load programs in through the ISP

# Programming Process
1. Pick a processor
2. Pick a Programmer
3. Pick a programming language

# Opcodes 

# Assembly language 
Each line is one opcode.  
You can name variables. 

# AVR Libc

Standard libraries implemented for arc architecture

# talking to the computer (host) from the microcontroller

The processor has pins for sending serial data. you can get a usb to serial connector. 

# Arduino

- set of c libs 
- in AN IDE 
- with a bootloader
- for AVRs

# Other Boards
Monday at 5 - section talking about bigger boards such a Maple

# Assignment 
- Read a microcontroller data sheet
- program your board to do something with as many different programming languages and programming environments as possible. 

Do all this for the AVRs

# Register 

a named memory location  
each pin on the avr microcontroller has three registers
 - one input
 - one output
 - 

# pull up resistor in inputs
Any IO pin on the Attiny44a can be an input or an output. To write configure the pullup resistor. write. 

# Batteries
20mhz you need be at 5 volts  
Look up `speed grades` in the data sheet for more specs.

Power consumption is linear with clock speed.
You can set a lower clock speed. for example use a watch clock (32hz)


# East Campus Gurus
Guillermo Bernal - will announce times over email

# 32 bit architectures

## Raspberri Pi

- 30$
- GPIOs acessible through Python.
- For booting linux on an embedable system.
- Processor Documentation is proprietary
- lots of IO - composite video, hdmi, audio
- can run linux off the SD card
- adafruit has nice instructions on how to install linux to the SD card


## STM32

- 3$
- ARM based
- To get an ethernet port
  - SLIP is one option 
  - Connectors that go strait to the board, and have an ethernet jack (WIZnet)
  - The two dollar embedded solution MRF49XA

# RandomFacts

AVRs and STMs: *Most* instruction are a single clock cycle
