# Input devices

# ADC 
There is one ADC and you can switch it to different pins. It's complicated -- Lot's of registers

- Reference - a thousand = what?
- gain? 
- Enable, start converting
- Convert once, convert continuously
- Clock divider

# Clock fuses

# Neils Serial 

Sometimes clocks on the attiny45 are not accurate enough to use serial communication with the computer. 

1. OSCALL
2. #define bit_delay_time 100

# Magnetic field into voltage

- Proximity (is your laptop closed or open)
- orientation (upside down or not)

# Earth Field is very sensitive

# Temperature - thermoresister

- ntc - more accurate at lower temperatures
- rtd - better at higher temperatures

# Light phototransistor 

The ones we use are bipolar. These use a pull-up resistor (we will need add these).

# Step Response

Neil likes these. THey can be used for just about anything. 

# Sound

# others

3 axis 

# A Bridge

helps you find the difference between two voltages.
